# Portfolio Project Enhancements

The following are proposed technical enhancements for each of my portfolio projects. These tasks focus on state management, performance, scalability, security, and interactive features to make the applications more robust and appealing to employers.

## Baby Tracker App (React/Python)
- Integrate Redux Toolkit or Zustand for predictable state management across components.
- Add real-time data sync with WebSockets or Firebase Realtime Database.
- Validate user inputs and implement comprehensive error handling in both client and server.
- Introduce push notifications or reminders for events like feedings or medication.
- Use asynchronous tasks and caching (e.g., Redis) to optimize backend performance.
- Secure endpoints with JWT-based authentication and encrypt sensitive user data.

## Warhammer Campaign Manager (Python/React)
- Provide drag-and-drop tools for setting up custom scenarios on the game board.
- Enable real-time dice rolling using WebSocket connections for multiplayer sessions.
- Add JSON import/export to simplify campaign sharing between players.
- Allow scalable storage options such as AWS S3 or Firebase Storage for images and assets.
- Generate PDF or printable resources using jsPDF or Python's ReportLab library.
- Improve React performance with lazy-loading, React.memo, and useCallback.

## Home Automation & Networking (Raspberry Pi/Python)
- Create automated backup and recovery scripts to maintain reliability.
- Integrate monitoring dashboards using Grafana and Prometheus; optionally block ads with Pi-hole.
- Use SSH keys and WireGuard VPN for secure remote access to devices.
- Schedule periodic maintenance and automate software updates.
- Expand media server functionality with Plex or Emby, ensuring a mobile-friendly interface.

## 3D Printing Workflow
- Automate model processing and slicing via Python scripts or Cura APIs.
- Build a React/Node.js dashboard to track print jobs and status remotely.
- Track printer component usage for predictive maintenance alerts.
- Collect and visualize metrics on material consumption and print quality.
- Support real-time updates through WebSockets or RESTful APIs.

## Investment Portfolio Tracker (Python/React)
- Connect to financial APIs such as Alpha Vantage or IEX Cloud for market data.
- Present interactive dashboards with libraries like Recharts or Chart.js.
- Implement caching and incremental updates using Redis and Celery for efficiency.
- Add alerting when markets move significantly or portfolio thresholds are met.
- Ensure secure authentication and encrypt stored financial data.
